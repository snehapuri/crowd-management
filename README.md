Overview
CrowdFlow is a deep-learning-based crowd monitoring system designed to track individual movement in real time, detect anomalies, give real-time alerts and generate heatmaps. It uses YOLOv5 for object detection and DeepSORT for identity tracking, along with density monitoring and geospatial mapping capabilities.

Features
✅ Person Tracking – Uses YOLOv5 & DeepSORT for robust individual tracking </br>
✅ Anomaly Detection – Detects unusual movement patterns with configurable alert triggers </br>
✅ Density-Based Alerts – Sends notifications when predefined crowd thresholds are exceeded </br>
✅ Heatmap Generation – Visualizes crowd density and movement trends over time </br>
✅ Geospatial Mapping – Computes precise locations using camera metadata (location, height, angle) </br>
✅ Multi-Camera Support – Monitors multiple video feeds simultaneously </br>


Modify according to use:
Detection Thresholds
Camera Height & Angle
Alert Sensitivity
